# rdb_ser_data: A relational database for research data from science education research

## Objective of Project
Build a relational database for typical quantitative science education research data with a high generalisability for other studies so that it can be used and further developed by different researchers. 
In this way, we aim to make research more efficient and improve data quality internally and for FAIR use of data (Wilkinson et al., 2016).

## Purposes:
1. Archiving research data
2. Data entry
3. Data deletion
4. Enabling secondary analysis

## Current Stage of the project: 
1. A conceptual model has been built
2. A (partial) physical model has been built

**Note**: The database currently serves the purpose of communicating a data model (most of the settings are default settings in MySQLWorkbench 8.0). The database cannot be implemented at this stage and is not tested.
